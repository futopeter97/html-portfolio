          <li>Some blankets, since we're going outside!</li>
          <li>Any snack you love, or feel like would be missing</li>
          <li>You're good mood</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>What you don't have to bring:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We took care of the drinks, so there's no need to bring it with you. However if you have a question feel free to shoot me a message</li>
          <li>Presents. I'm not organising this event, to flood myself with presents. I just want to have a good time with you all!
