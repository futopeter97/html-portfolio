    <p>Hi! My name is Peter Futo</p>
    <p>I recently had the idea to start learning programming and lately web development. 
      I already finished successfully a Java Backend course, and I wanted to expand my knowledge, so the obvious choice was Web Developement. 
      I'm still in the early stages, but I hope that one day I'll be able to create good looking, functional, and useful websites</p>
    <p>Before heading to the IT world, I used to work as a contractor in sound engineering, and music producement. 
      And, well, as the picture might tell you I also played in a band. These stayed in my life as hobbies, and I can be very passionate about them.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions, tips, tricks on my learning journey, feel free to write me an email, which you can find on my 
      <a href="./contact.html">contact</a> page!</p>

    <p>Thank you for checking out this portfolio of mine!</p>
    <p>Peter</p>
